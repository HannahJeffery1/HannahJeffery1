- Repository purpose: Providing personalized, annotated coding resources used for RNA-sequencing projects related to DESeq2, edgeR, WGCNA, and topGO. These scripts were designed to analyze transcriptomic data collected from dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The data was collected from pairs of brown and yellow dry beans with contrasting cooking times (fast vs. slow) at multiple soaking time points (0-18 hours in water) to investigate the genetic control of cooking time in dry beans.
